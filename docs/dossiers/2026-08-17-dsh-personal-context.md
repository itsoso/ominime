# DSH Personal Context Dossier

## Current status

- Current stage: S3 feasibility and risk review, source-owned interface reframe.
- Current decision: **G2 reframe approved; still BLOCKED at G2**.
- Delivery guard: Task 7 and all downstream implementation are prohibited until
  G2 passes for both required chat sources.
- Runtime guard: the existing legacy keyboard/OCR capture remains active and
  unchanged. No real service or deployment was modified.
- Resume point: read this dossier, then the
  [source gate](../verification/chat-source-gate.md) and
  [source-owned interface reframe](../plans/2026-08-18-source-owned-chat-interface-reframe-design.md), then the
  [implementation plan](../plans/2026-08-17-dsh-personal-context-hub-implementation.md).

## S0 Intake

### User request, verbatim

> “可以定时拉取kim和微信的聊天记录，这样应该是最好的，获取kim和微信，有发言的上下文，组织起来，区分哪些是我的，哪些是我回复的，形成针对kim和微信以及其他app的聊天记录，这样沉淀到自己的知识库，是一个比较靠谱的做法，结合自己的录音之后的asr，如果这样做，那应该重新设计，比如基于DSH，引入不同的上下文的来源，将自己在不同的app下的输入，作为一个上下文，存入到个人知识库。或者给出更好的设计。”

### User clarifications, verbatim

> “思考其他的解决方案 不走OCR”

> “要业务无感 对我无感”

> “DeepSeek Harness”

> “前者”

> “B是不是更好？”

> “可以 另外也需要一个GUI页面”

The intended user is the local device owner. The requested outcome is a
source-aware personal knowledge base combining qualifying Kim and WeChat
history, recording ASR, retrieval, and a GUI without visible interaction with
the chat applications. The current workaround is the legacy capture path; it is
preserved because the replacement has not passed feasibility.

## S1 Current-system survey

- The [baseline report](../verification/dsh-personal-context-baseline.md)
  records the existing OmniMe state, test baseline, pinned DSH release, and the
  requirement to preserve the legacy database and capture path.
- [DSH compatibility](../../dsh-plugin/DSH_COMPATIBILITY.md) records the local
  pinned-runtime evidence and the independent portable distribution constraint.
- The [WeChat report](../verification/wechat-source-feasibility.md) and
  [Kim report](../verification/kim-source-feasibility.md) contain redacted source
  evidence only.
- No generated system map exists for this repository, so this dossier does not
  restate architecture totals.

## S2 Requirement definition

The approved [design](../plans/2026-08-17-dsh-personal-context-hub-design.md)
defines the DSH-native B+ architecture, local data boundary, source-neutral
connector contract, participation semantics, ASR integration, retrieval, GUI,
and privacy constraints. It explicitly excludes OCR fallback, UI automation,
event interception, clipboard modification, network capture, process injection,
and guessed source facts.

The approved
[G2 reframe design](../plans/2026-08-18-source-owned-chat-interface-reframe-design.md)
adds a feasibility-only investigation of the Kim internal open platform and
WeChat-owned loopback listeners. It does not weaken the original exclusions or
authorize downstream implementation.

## S3 Plan and feasibility evidence

The [implementation plan](../plans/2026-08-17-dsh-personal-context-hub-implementation.md)
binds the work to test-first delivery and named gates. Evidence completed before
this decision includes:

- `docs: record personal context baseline`
- `feat: scaffold DSH personal context bundle`
- `feat: define personal context connector contract`
- `spike: verify structured WeChat source`
- `spike: verify structured Kim source`
- `docs: decide chat source feasibility gate`

These are commit subjects in repository history, avoiding environment-specific
references in the dossier. The authoritative feasibility decision is the
[source gate](../verification/chat-source-gate.md).

## S4 Requirement breakdown

The implementation plan decomposes the approved design into an isolated bundle,
source-neutral contract, source probes, gate decision, storage, normalization,
retrieval, GUI, ASR, shadow synchronization, service cutover, and acceptance.
Only the baseline, bundle scaffold, neutral contract, read-only feasibility
spikes, and G2 decision have been executed. No downstream production connector,
storage, migration, cutover, or deployment work was executed.

## S5 Implementation state

The branch contains only the pre-G2 scaffold, source-neutral interfaces,
fail-closed source probes, synthetic fixtures, and verification documents. The
production WeChat and Kim connectors remain disabled. Synthetic tests establish
parser and safety behavior only; they do not prove live source schemas,
semantics, stability, or business capability.

## Gate record

| Gate or constraint | Decision | Evidence and consequence |
|---|---|---|
| G1 local pinned DSH compatibility | `PASS` | [Compatibility report](../../dsh-plugin/DSH_COMPATIBILITY.md); limited to the pinned local runtime. |
| Portable npm RC5 distribution | `BLOCK` | Independent distribution constraint in the compatibility report; it neither changes nor resolves G2. |
| G2 source feasibility | **`BLOCKED at G2`** | [Source gate](../verification/chat-source-gate.md); both required sources lack safe live evidence. Stop before Task 7. |
| G3 data and privacy | `NOT STARTED` | Storage, participation filtering, normalization, and privacy implementation were not started. |
| G4 feature review | `NOT STARTED` | No downstream feature implementation exists to review. |
| G5 deployment health | `NOT STARTED` | No deployment was attempted. |
| G6 live acceptance | `NOT STARTED` | No production or live acceptance path was attempted. |

## G2 risk decision

The current adapters fail closed because they do not have an approved atomic
directory-descriptor/`openat` path helper or a source-owned read-only structured
interface. This does not prove that either application's business data lacks the
required capabilities. It means the capabilities cannot currently be evaluated
or used within the approved safety boundary.

Continuing would require unsafe or guessed source behavior and would violate the
design. Therefore no work may pass G2 with partial or synthetic-only evidence.

## Approved G2 reframe

The user approved the following boundaries:

- one-time enterprise SSO, application registration, and administrator approval
  are acceptable if later operation is unattended;
- dedicated test identities and an isolated macOS user are permitted;
- an undocumented WeChat-owned loopback interface may receive bounded standard
  protocol classification in the isolated environment;
- protocol guessing, authentication bypass, process injection, and private
  reverse engineering remain prohibited;
- the selected approach is Kim internal-open-platform validation plus isolated
  WeChat loopback classification.

The reframe is documented in the
[approved design](../plans/2026-08-18-source-owned-chat-interface-reframe-design.md).
It creates a new evidence path but does not change the current G2 decision.

Read-only research found no public personal-chat-history API for WeChat and no
public local chat interface for Kim. The existing third-party Chatlog process is
excluded because it is not source-owned, its upstream is unsupported after a
compliance notice, and its observed launch model exposes sensitive arguments.
No change to that process is authorized by this feature.

## Exact unblock conditions

1. Provide a reviewed atomic directory-FD/`openat` helper, or a source-owned
   read-only structured interface. Either is only a prerequisite, not a PASS.
2. Re-run both live redacted probes through the reviewed path.
3. Produce authoritative and stable live evidence for every required capability
   for both sources. Partial evidence remains `BLOCK`.

## Pending decision after reframe evidence

No further product decision is required before writing the reframe investigation
plan. After the isolated probes complete, the user must review the revised G2
evidence. Continuing Task 7 or disabling the legacy capture path remains
prohibited unless that review marks both sources `PASS`.

## Deployment and acceptance

No deployment occurred. G5 and G6 were not entered, no rollback point was
needed, and no production acceptance claim is made.
